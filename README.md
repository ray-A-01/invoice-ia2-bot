### What is this?
This is an automated solution for a monthly billing process that I do for my client: IA2. Every month, I have to prepare and send an invoice to the client for the services I provide to them.

### Why UiPath?
This bot was built using UiPath particularly to practice my UiPath skills.

### Why automate the process?
* Reduced manual effort
* Quicker realization of income by way of earliest dispatch of invoice to client 

### High-level steps
 1. Retrieve timesheet screenshots 
 2. Calculate hours and income
 3. Prepare the invoice
 4. Prepare and send relevant emails
 5. Update QuickBooks

### Where can I find more details on the process?
Please refer to the PDD for the business process. It contains detailed steps performed as part of the billing process. Also, refer to the input files as well as the output files to better understand how the bot works.
